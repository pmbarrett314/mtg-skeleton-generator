I made this as a simple webapp to generate cardlists to import into deck builders for use in creating Magic: the Gathering draft archetype skeletons.

Currently making no commitments on supporting it, updating it, or leaving it up in the event that it starts costing money, but feel free to add issues or PRs, and I'll get to them if time and energy allows.
